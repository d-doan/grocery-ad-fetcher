          <p>&emsp;What is this? This web-application aims to streamline grocery shopping in the 21st century. 
            It aims to do so through two main features: compiling grocery store advertisements each week while 
            also maintaining a mailing list for a user's preferred stores.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The advertisements can be found in the "Weekly-Ads" page located on the taskbar above. 
            Whereas the signup for the mailing list can be found below, where each Wednesday you can receive a copy of
            grocery ads of your choosing sent to your email.

          <p>&emsp;Why a grocery-store webscraper? Strangely enough this project was the end result of an amalgamation of a broke college kid living on his own and his coupon-loving immigrant mother. 
            During the past two years, she would come up to me and request my help in helping her download, create an account, and navigate various digital grocery store ads. 
            <br>
            &emsp;On the other hand, I began to cook for myself this year and underwent a frighting realization on how expensive food is. These two developments would lead me to the creation of this tool 
            in hopes of making 21st century grocery shopping more accessible while also encouraging myself to budget out and plan my own meals.</p>
